/**
 * Pokes use a multi-part format. Pokes send entity data to the client and can
 * be multiple mega-bytes in size. Using a multi-part format allows the server
 * to avoid having to have the full poke in memory at one time.
 *
 * Each poke is assigned a `pokeID`, a unique id (within the context of the
 * connection) for identifying the poke.  All messages for a poke will have the
 * same `pokeID`.
 *
 * A poke begins with a `poke-start` message which contains the `baseCookie`
 * the poke is updating from and the `cookie` the poke is updating to.
 *
 * The poke continues with zero to many `poke-part` messages, each of which
 * can contain patch parts.  These patch parts should be merged in the order
 * received.
 *
 * Finally, the poke ends with a `poke-end` message.  The merged `poke-parts`
 * can now be applied as a whole to update from `baseCookie` to `cookie`.
 *
 * Poke messages can be intermingled with other `down` messages, but cannot be
 * intermingled with poke messages for a different `pokeID`. If this is
 * observed it is an unexpected error; the client should ignore both pokes,
 * disconnect, and reconnect.
